              <strong>2015 - 2018</strong> - Dhoni Biopic, Raabta and Kedarnath - In 2011, a biopic on the life of the Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was conceived by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey.[67] The project was initially faced with various difficulties including objections from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Dhoni's demand for a large royalty.[68][69] On 25 September 2014, Sushant Singh Rajput was announced as the actor who would play the role of Dhoni in the biopic which was titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and directed by Neeraj Pandey.[68][70] The film was centered around the life of the cricketer beginning with his childhood in the city of Ranchi and leading up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory for India under his captaincy.[46] Incidentally, Rajput wasn't adept at cricket and had to train regularly in the game for 13 months as well as capture the playing style of Dhoni for his portrayal in the film,[67] he was coached by Kiran More who reportedly trained him in the regimen of a professional sportsperson rather than as an actor.[71] The film was produced by Arun Pandey with Fox Star Studios and released on 2 October 2016.[72] It became the 5th highest grossing Bollywood film of that year.[73] Rajput received critical acclaim for his performance and nominations to a number of awards,[2] including the Filmfare Awards, the International Indian Film Academy Awards and the winning nomination at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.[74][41][75] He also made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Welcome to New York,[76] which was released on 23 February 2018 and where the lead characters met Rajput but confused him for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

              <strong>Death</strong> - On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan[1] in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[183] He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from bipolar disorder.[184][185][186] The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.[187] The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"[188] and called it a "clear case of suicide."[189] The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time).[190] No foul play was found.[191] The viscera report likewise ruled out foul play.[192] On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.[193]

              On 31 July, Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a case to investigate the money laundering of Rajput's money from his bank accounts by Chakraborty, her parents and associates.[194] On 19 August 2020, the Supreme Court of India allowed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Indian national government's top investigating agency, to take control of the investigation[195] and ordered the CBI to look into any future cases registered in relation to Rajput's death.[196] Later, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) also filed a case to investigate drug peddling, based on phone chats forwarded to it by ED during its investigation.[197]
              
              On 8 September, Rhea Chakraborty was arrested by the NCB in a drug case linked to the investigation of the death probe. Prior to the arrest, 9 others were arrested by the NCB in the drug case including Rhea's brother, Showik Chakraborty.[198]
              
              On 3 October, Dr. Sudhir Gupta of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, leader of a forensic medical team tasked by CBI for assistance, said, "Sushant death is a case of suicide. Murder completely ruled out."[199] Gupta told Asian News International (ANI), "There were no injuries over the body other than hanging. There were no marks of struggle or scuffle in the body and clothes of the deceased."[200] On 5 October, ANI reported that the AIIMS medical board had submitted its report to CBI confirming that Rajput died by suicide and ruling out murder.[201] On 15 October 2020, the CBI said it "continues to investigate the death of Rajput. There are certain speculative reports in the media that the CBI has reached a conclusion. It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous.
